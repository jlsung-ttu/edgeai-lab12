"""Lab 12 smoke tests — minimal CPU-only assertions that don't need GPU.

These tests run inside GitHub's free hosted runner (Ubuntu x86), so they
must not import torch with CUDA, must not load TensorRT, and must not
require the IMX219 camera. Their job is to catch the obvious 'I broke
the import graph' or 'the YOLO model file is corrupted' failures BEFORE
the slower Docker build job spends 10 min building an ARM64 image.

Run locally with:    pytest -v tests/

Note: this is the Step 1 baseline (4 functions / 6 collected items via
parametrization). Step 2 introduces the Dockerfile refactor +
entrypoint.sh, both of which are verified by validate_step2.sh rather
than by additional pytest cases — that keeps the pytest smoke set
stable across steps and avoids tests that would deliberately fail on
the first push.
